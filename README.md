## Introduction

Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects memory, thinking, and behavior. Early diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's Disease can greatly help in providing timely intervention and treatment to patients. This repository provides a deep learning model based on the NASNet Large architecture to predict the likelihood of a patient developing Alzheimer's Disease.

## Objective

The objective is to leverage artificial intelligence techniques to develop a robust and accurate system for the early detection and diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The project uses advanced machine learning and deep learning to analyze medical data, in the form of brain MRI scans to identify Alzheimer's biomarkers and patterns.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of medical imaging data, specifically brain MRI scans, collected from patients with and without Alzheimer's Disease. The dataset used in this project is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing restrictions. However, you can obtain similar datasets from publicly available sources or by collaborating with research institutions and obtaining appropriate permissions.
The data is divided into 4 categories:-

   -Very Mild Demented
   -Mild Demented
   -Moderate Demented
   -Non Demented

## Model Architecture

NASNet (Neural Architecture Search Network) is a deep learning architecture that autonomously discovers and optimizes its neural network structure. By utilizing a neural architecture search algorithm, it explores a vast space of potential architectures to determine the optimal configuration for specific tasks, like image classification.
NASNet architecture stands out for its exceptional performance on image classification tasks with features such as Architecture Optimization, Large-Scale Pretraining, Efficiency and Scalability, Transfer Learning Capability and State-of-the-Art Performance, making it a favorable choice for this Alzheimer's Prediction project. The weights of the model are pretrained on a large-scale dataset and fine-tuned on the Alzheimer's Disease dataset provided.


## Usage

To use this Alzheimer's Disease prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/alzheimers-prediction-nasnet-large.git
   

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.
   bash
   cd alzheimers-prediction-nasnet-large
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Preprocess your brain MRI scans into the appropriate format required by the model. Ensure that your data is organized in a suitable directory structure.

4. Train the model using the preprocessed data. Adjust the hyperparameters and training configurations as per your requirements.
   bash
   python train.py
   

5. After training, you can use the trained model to make predictions on new brain MRI scans. Adjust the prediction script according to your needs.
   bash
   python predict.py --image path/to/brain_mri_scan.jpg
   

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of around 80% on the Alzheimer's Disease prediction task. It should be noted that the performance of the model may vary depending on the quality and size of the dataset used for training.

## Future

Future efforts may include incorporating advanced deep learning architectures, transfer learning methods, ensemble models, and multimodal data integration to improve diagnostic accuracy. By incorporating AI methods, the project can assist in the identification of personalized treatment approaches for individuals with Alzheimer's disease.
The project can contribute to the field of neuroimaging analysis by exploring novel techniques and algorithms for the interpretation of brain MRI scans
